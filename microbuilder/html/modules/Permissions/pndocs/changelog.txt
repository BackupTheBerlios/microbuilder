Description V0.1:
=================
Original version as shipped with PostNuke up to PN.723

Description V0.2:
=================
The PN-permission system is hard enough as it stands.
Since I'm also using it for an Intranet-site, I'm quite heavily relying on it.
There are (i.m.h.o.) a couple of badly needed improvements to be made on the
admin-part.

This patch allows you (or at least, the site-admin...) to insert a new permission
directly at the spot where it is supposed to be.
Especially with larger permission-lists, this will save you the hassle of 'dragging'
the newly added permission up to where it should be.

Description V0.3:
=================
First of all, security has been tightened up. It seems certain functions of the Permission-
module were accessible without having the right permissions. Fixed (in an almost paranoid way).

FilterView:
Furthermore, you can now select a group and get a listing of the permissions that apply to that
group (i.e. permissions set for 'All Groups' and that specific group in one list). To remind you
of what you're doing, a warningmessage appears on top.
Moving permissions around while in FilterView is limited. After all, it is easy to forget the 
permissions of other groups and unintentionally swap a permission of a group that is not shown.
Well, it seems harder than it is, I guess. The module will prohibit permission-dragging if you're
about to make potential mistakes. Dragging in full view still works as it used to, of course.
Inserting and modifying permissions in FilterView is possible, though restricted to the group that
is currently shown.

B.T.W.: the module-pictures have been moved to the module-directory. No more global pics.

Description V0.4:
=================
I'm not sure if this can still make it into the PN.726 core, but I didn't want to release it before
it had the features I needed. Otherwise there would be upgrade after upgrade.
It now has:
- In-list modifying;
- In-list creation of new and inserted permissions;
- User-selectable settings as to using the filterlist, the warningbar and the rowheight.
