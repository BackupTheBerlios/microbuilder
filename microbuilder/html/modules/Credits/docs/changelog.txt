Version 1.0 released 10/22/2002
- Displays active user modules and supported docs for modules and PostNuke itself.

Version 1.1 released 1/3/2003
- Previous version opened a big security hole allowing knowledgeable hackers to view any file source within the PostNuke installation.  Version 1.1 closes the whole by routing all calls through form submission rather then URL, and by authenticating all requests.
