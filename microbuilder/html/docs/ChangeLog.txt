We've got something to cheer about! PostNuke .726 is Ready for Download
________________________

After a few weeks of additional hard work .726 is ready for download.
This release is an excellent package and provides a system you can use
on any professional site today! Read on for more details. This also
marks a turning point where we will be taking the software to a new
level with new functionality. One thing you can always count on though
is the paradigm shift will be transparent to the end user. Our goal is
to provide you with flexibility without the complexity. I know this is a
challenge but we're up for it.

This message is a chance for me to let you know what we've been working
on since the last release.

This release has several cosmetic changes as well as usability changes
we're sure you'll enjoy using.

HTML 4.01 & CSS Compliance: Credit to Mark West and larsneo for taking
on the project. This was a task that required touching many files within
the system to make sure it all parsed correctly and validated.

Permissions Systems Updates: Credit to Marc Maes who contributed the
code on the main mods site and thanks to larsneo for integrating into
the main core. Additional credit goes to Adam and Mark West for code
refinement. The new permissions provides enhancements to inserting
permission, in-table editing/inserting and adding of permissions,
filtering of shown permissions allowing you to show all the permissions
that apply to a specific group. There are layout refinements and updates
the configurations.

A note of special thanks and credit goes to Andreas (aka larsneo) who
went through every module ensuring that all have the relevant
permissions calls and the WHERE clause fixes were applied to all modules
as appropriate to prevent any potential SQL injection issues.

ADOdb : credit to larsneo Database Abstraction Layer Upgraded to 3.60:
More Information about ADODB can be found at

AvantGo - Mobile News Module Update: Credit to larsneo .726 note:
permissions for 'Stories: Story’ and 'Topics: Topic’ components are
fixed

As many of you know the AvantGo module allows you to pull information
from the web to read on your PDA, Pocket, or next-generation phone.

Autolinks Permissions Updates: Credit to larsneo.  Fixed permission
schema, enhanced module security against script injection

Admin Message Update: Credit to aarrog.  Applied patch #275 (use

A big thx to Michael Cohen : for providing basic source code auditing
and due to various security related fixes over the complete code base an
